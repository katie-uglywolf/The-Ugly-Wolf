        contacts. If you have background location data turned on by granting us permission through your
        device’s location settings and in your privacy settings, we will, from time to time, obtain your device’s
        location even if you are not directly interacting with the App. Other than in an anonymized,
        pseudonymized or aggregated form, your location is never shared with others, except with your consent
