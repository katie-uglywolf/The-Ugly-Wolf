        appropriate authorization; or
        • use a User Name that is a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene or otherwise

      <p class="legal_body">
        These Terms of Use will be governed by and construed in accordance with US federal law to the extent
        applicable and the laws of the State of Connecticut, excluding its conflicts of law rules. The applicable
        States Federal District Courts or state courts located in Connecticut will have exclusive jurisdiction to
        resolve any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms of Services and your use of the

      <h6 class="legal_header">Integration and Severability.</h6>

      <p class="legal_body">
        These Terms of Use (inclusive of the Privacy Policy) are the entire agreement between you and Klos with
        respect to the Service and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals
        (whether oral, written or electronic) between you and Klos with respect to the Service. If any provision of
        these Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to
        the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms of Use will otherwise remain in full force and effect
        and enforceable. The failure of Klos to exercise in any respect any right provided will not be deemed a
        waiver of any other or further rights. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance does not mean Klos
        will waive compliance in the future. In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of Use to be
        binding, Klos must provide you with written notice of such waiver through one of its authorized
        representatives.
